# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The company Pewlett Hackard is analyzing how many employees will start to leave the company due to retirement. In this project it was created different tables in Postgres to identify the number of retiring employees in the different departments of the company. Also it was wasked to group different people that could be eligible for a mentorship program to mitigate the impact of the retiring members.

## Results

* The number of employees that are near to retirement is staggering, near 40k people are next to face retirement in the company

* There are only two managers that are near retirement, meaning key positions in the company are not in risk of facing an abrupt change
